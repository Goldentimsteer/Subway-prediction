# Subway-prediction
For our last assingment I was apart of a team that made a prediction system for one of our proffesors.
The assignment was to make a application that could figure out if a city was a good option for a subway, 
We ended up not making it into a full blown application becasue there are far more information to base if a 
City should have a Subway. But ended up making a prediction tree to determin if a city was fit for a subway
